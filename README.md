# Midjourney Client

## NOTICE

Due to changes to Replicate's API, it is no longer possible to run models anonymously. As such, this project, along with [`node-replicate`](https://github.com/Oelin/node-replicate) have been depreciated. We recommend switching to Replicate's official API.

---

Replicate.com now requires GitHub authentication to run model demos. As such, this project, along with `node-replicate` are now depreciated. We recommend switching to Replicate's official API.
